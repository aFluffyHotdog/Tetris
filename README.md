# Arcade


Well, I haven't coded in C in 2 years, and I've been on python the whole time. Now that the training wheels are off, I'd just like to document 

20/9
- Learned what a destructor is
- learned the average class structure for a c++ program??

21/9
- The rule of the big 5: If you modify a class constructor, you should also manually write the destructor, copier, assignment and move
- a reference in c++ is just a c pointer with less functionalities
  
22/9
- ints in c++ has 4 bits.... fuck python man
